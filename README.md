# Remove Ads

If you are a Theme or Plugin developer and wish for you theme or plugin to be directly linked to your github instead of an ad link then please make a PR for your OWN belonging. I don't "steal" anyones work. This site is simply a showcase of peoples themes and plugins so they can be recognized by a larger crowd.

# Why Have Ads?

I did make the site all by myself with the help of Jiiks (Creator of BD) on creating the theme preview and everyones opinions. I don't think having ads will kill anyone and like I said before if you don't want me recieving revenue from your work then make a PR.

#Do you host anything malicous ?

Why would I? I simple made this to help people why would anyone host a website on Github when all the source code is available to see? If you want look for yourself and if you see anything malicous that is from ME then tell me and I will personally take down the site.

#Ads have malware!

I don't get to choose what type of ads get displayed to you. I simply use Google Adsense and Shorte.st and they will display whatever they want. If they display anything malicous I have no part in it. I have simple no control in what they host.
